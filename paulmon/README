# PAULMON

This is a basic monitor system, which allows the uploading of code to the device. See:

https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/paulmon2.html

This has been augmented with a library (OysterLib) of hardware related functions which can control:

 * Memory page selection (0x8000-0xFFFF PSEN/XRAM space fully configurable between ROM/RAM/RAM card)
 * I2C library (bitbang interface on p1.6/p1.7)
 * RTC library (accesses hardware i2c RTC)
 * Keyboard functions to detect key presses
 * LCD library (character based functions to print to screen)
 * Misc functions (non-specific functions which don't group together, e.g. beep function)

In addition, PAULMON supports the easy inclusion of additional commands. Several commands have been implemented to
'breakout' OysterLib capabilities, these include:

 * Memory page selection tool
 * I2C tool (bus scan/register read/write)
