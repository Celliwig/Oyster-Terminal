# PAULMON

This is a basic monitor system, which allows the uploading of code to the device. See:

https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/paulmon2.html

This has been augmented with a library (OysterLib) of hardware related functions which can control:

 * Memory page selection (0x8000-0xFFFF PSEN/XRAM space fully configurable between ROM/RAM/RAM card)
 * I2C library (bitbang interface on p1.6/p1.7)
 * RTC library (accesses hardware i2c RTC)
 * Keyboard functions to detect key presses
 * LCD library (character based functions to print to screen)
 * Misc functions (non-specific functions which don't group together, e.g. beep function)

In addition, PAULMON supports the easy inclusion of additional commands. Several commands have been implemented to
'breakout' OysterLib capabilities, these include:

 * Memory page selection tool
 * I2C tool (bus scan/register read/write)

## Assembler

PAULMON and, by extension, OysterLib, have been developed to be compiled with 'as31'. Packages are available for
Ubuntu.

While the hex (Intel format) output from as31 can be downloaded directly to the device (while it's running PAULMON),
and ROM programming software can generally load multiple files, it can be useful to be able to concatenate multiple 
files together. This can be acheived using 'srec_cat' (available in the 'srecord' package). It's argument format is:

srec_cat example1.hex -intel example2.hex -intel -output example12.hex -intel
