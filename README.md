# Oyster-Terminal

This device was picked up at a computer fair as something to experiment with. Having extracted the ROM it was
determined that the included code provided an interface for servicing/reading electricity meters, and also included 
a BASIC interpreter. Unfortunately the interpreter had been disabled to a certain degree (by the removal of commands 
for example), so a replacement ROM was neccessary.

Being based on the 80C562 (a derivative of the 8051) a number of different options, whether a monitor or BASIC 
interpreter, are readily available. To maximise programmability a combination of monitor (PAULMON) and BASIC 
(MCS BASIC) was selected. These were then developed to support the hardware in question.
